This file briefly describes how to install the Confix source distribution.
(Other methods include installing Confix from a package, but describing how to
install packages is not the point of this file).

Confix distribution is done using the Python Distutils package.

Unpack the file; for example,

    $ pwd
    /home/jfasch
    $ tar zxplf Confix-1.3.0.tar.gz

Then make a call to Distutils to build and install the source.

    $ cd Confix-1.3.0
    $ pwd
    /home/jfasch/Confix-1.3.0
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/sandbox

Then, provided the prefix you gave wasn't a standard one like /usr or
/usr/local, you should update your environment accordingly. For example, you
could add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc :

    PREFIX=${HOME}/sandbox
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PREFIX}/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages
    export PATH=${PATH}:${PREFIX}/bin

Make sure A.B corresponds to the version of Python that you use, such as 2.1 or
2.2. You will need to open up a new shell if you had to update your original
PYTHONPATH / PATH environment variables.

That's it, you're ready to use Confix. Try out the installation by calling up
the command line help :

    $ confix.py --help
